=== 1.0.2 / 2012-01-27

* Improved the implementation and testing of float equality (Ft).
  There is a backwards-incompatible change in that Ft no longer
  accepts an epsilon argument. If Ft doesn't work for you with
  the built-in value (1e-13) then it's probably a bug in this
  library. Theoretically, this should be version 2.0.0, but that
  seems silly and I don't think anyone will be affected. Sorry
  if you are.

* Correct Ruby dependency set in the gemspec (>= 1.8.7).

=== 1.0.1 / 2012-01-02

* Correction in README.txt

=== 1.0.0 / 2012-01-02
