Whitestone 1.0.1, a unit testing library, was released on 2012-01-02.  This
update, 1.0.2, improves the implementation of float-equality testing,
especially regarding numbers near zero. As it stands, floats are considered
equal if their 14th significant figure is off by one. There is no provision
for specifying a tolerance: it is supposed to just work, and if it doesn't
then it's a bug.

Key features of Whitestone include terse testing code, colorful and
helpful output, custom assertions, a powerful and intuitive test
runner, simple debugger integration. The homepage explains and
demonstrates it well.

Here are the assertion methods:
  T  -- assert true
  F  -- assert false
  N  -- assert object is nil
  Eq -- assert two objects are equal
  Mt -- assert string matches regular expression
  Id -- assert two objects are identical (same object)
  E  -- assert error is raised
  Ko -- assert an object is kind_of a class/module
  Ft -- assert two floats are essentially equal
  C  -- assert object is thrown

Hi all,

A long time ago, I imagined my ideal unit testing library.  In the middle of
2010, I created it (using Suraj N Karaputi's "dfect" v2.1.0 as a starting point)
and called it "attest", but never got around to releasing it.  Well now I have.
Except the name "attest" is taken, so I renamed it "whitestone": it's the nicest
sounding word in /usr/share/dict/words containing the word "test".

It's not going to take over the testing world, but it's what keeps my Ruby
projects in line.  If you're interested in testing libraries, you'll find it
worth a look.  Note: "test" not "spec".  And there's no mocks, stubs, etc.
either.  I'm not knocking those things, but they haven't been necessary for my
projects.

Here are the assertion methods:
  T  -- assert true
  F  -- assert false
  N  -- assert object is nil
  Eq -- assert two objects are equal
  Mt -- assert string matches regular expression
  Id -- assert two objects are identical (same object)
  E  -- assert error is raised
  Ko -- assert an object is kind_of a class/module
  Ft -- assert two floats are essentially equal
  C  -- assert object is thrown

Key features include terse code, colorful and helpful output, custom assertions,
a powerful and intuitive test runner, simple debugger integration.
