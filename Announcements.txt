Hi all,

A long time ago, I imagined my ideal unit testing library.  In the middle of
2010, I created it (using Suraj N Karaputi's "dfect" v2.1.0 as a starting point)
and called it "attest", but never got around to releasing it.  Well now I have.
Except the name "attest" is taken, so I renamed it "whitestone": it's the nicest
sounding word in /usr/share/dict/words containing the word "test".

It's not going to take over the testing world, but it's what keeps my Ruby
projects in line.  If you're interested in testing libraries, you'll find it
worth a look.  Note: "test" not "spec".  And there's no mocks, stubs, etc.
either.  I'm not knocking those things, but they haven't been necessary for my
projects.

Here are the assertion methods:
  T  -- assert true
  F  -- assert false
  N  -- assert object is nil
  Eq -- assert two objects are equal
  Mt -- assert string matches regular expression
  Id -- assert two objects are identical (same object)
  E  -- assert error is raised
  Ko -- assert an object is kind_of a class/module
  Ft -- assert two floats are essentially equal
  C  -- assert object is thrown

Key features include terse code, colorful and helpful output, custom assertions,
a powerful and intuitive test runner, simple debugger integration.
